# Wine

## Overview

A **Wine** record acts as the blueprint for a specific label. It captures the core details (vintage, vineyard, etc.) that define what is in the bottle.

### Concept

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Wine** | Blueprint of a particular wine |
| **Bottle** | An individual unit of wine, tracked by its specific location in your cellar. |

A single Wine record may have many bottles stored across different shelves or racks.

### Example

You might have:

- **Wine**: Alde Gott Sasbacher Limburg Riesling 2021
- 12 **Bottles** entries linked to it, each with a defined storage location.

This separation allows you to:

- Keep clean records of your cellar contents  
- Manage bottles individually  
- Track vintages, tasting notes, and inventory history
